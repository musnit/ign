I'm a South African who graduated last year here, with a degree in maths and computer science. I'm very interested in this program. I'm interested in the games industry in general, and would also really like to work in the USA for a while. I don't know if the program would require a full working visa, or if it includes accommodation, but I do have family in San Francisco that I'm sure I could stay at. I think I would be a good fit for it because I have the necessary skills and experience, and use IGN often and am a fan of the website and of the games industry in general. I'm sure that I would be highly motivated working at IGN. I have knowledge and experience with most the mentioned languages and tools, and I am a quick learner and am able to pick up and use new languages easily. My studies also included various other languages and courses in various fields of computing, and significant maths and computer science theory. I play tons of games, am an avid competitive gamer and have participated and succeeded in many gaming competitions and also many programming/algorithm competitions. Mail me back for references/more details about any of the above.
